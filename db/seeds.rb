# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Student.destroy.all
Student.create([{first_name: 'stoodent', last_name: '0'}, {first_name: 'stewdent', last_name: '1'} ,{first_name: 'student', last_name: '2'}, {first_name: 'studint', last_name: '3'}])
